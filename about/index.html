<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Members of the Fœderatio Internationalis Juventutem (FIJ) work for the
  sanctification of youth – both at the triennial World Youth Days as well as in
  the local dioceses and parishes.
</p>
<p>
  Members of international Juventutem federation have an interest in and love of
  the Traditional Latin Mass – which is also known as the ‘Tridentine Mass,’ the
  ‘Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite,’ the ‘Gregorian Mass,’ and the ‘usus
  antiquior’ (older use).
</p>
<p>
  The name ‘Juventutem’ itself is the Latin word for youth and it appears in the
  opening lines of the traditional Mass.
</p>
<p>
  This is the website of the FIJ.&nbsp;&nbsp;The international Juventutem
  federation is the official structure gathering all groups and individuals
  linked with Juventutem throughout the world. Founded on the Feast of Our Lady
  Help of Christians on May 24, 2006 (in Bern, Switzerland), the FIJ enjoys
  moral personality.
</p>
<p>
  In 2006, there were 31 co-founders originating from 16 countries on every
  continent: Russia, Germany, Australia, Italy, China, Ireland, Brazil,
  Great-Britain, France, USA, Hungary, Switzerland, Kenya, Spain, The
  Netherlands and Austria.
</p>
<p>
  An independent non-political youth structure loyal to Roman Catholic
  authorities, the Fœderatio Internationalis Juventutem drew inspiration from
  the&nbsp;<a
    href="http://www.fiuv.org/"
    target="_blank"
    style="color: rgb(25, 130, 209)"
    >International Una Voce Federation</a
  >&nbsp;as well as from various other Catholic institutions.
</p>
<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>
<p>
  The Fœderatio Internationalis Juventutem is a Catholic network fostering the
  sanctification of the youths worldwide according to the Roman traditions of
  the Church. We wish to contribute to the sanctification of the members of
  Juventutem and of any youths who are our contemporaries.
</p>
<p><strong>Precisions:</strong></p>
<p>
  Membership and the commitments that it involves are automatically renewed each
  year on the feast of Our Lady Help of Christians (24 May), unless a contrary
  choice is explicitly notified.
</p>
<p>
  When accidentally failing to keep one of his/her commitments, a member does
  not commit a sin (unless it be out of conscious neglect).
</p>
<p>
  As a lay Catholic organisation, Juventutem does not depend on any particular
  clerical community or on any political movement.
</p>
<p><strong>Communion of saints</strong></p>
<p>
  Obviously, none of the commitments suggested has been invented by us. They are
  well-known means of sanctification. But are they as widely used as they are
  known?
</p>
<p>
  We believe that using those means of sanctification in our capacity of
  Juventutem members will benefit us better than using them as sheer
  individuals. Why? As members of a youth network such as Juventutem, we know
  that throughout the world, there are Catholic youths praying God within His
  Church like us, for us and with us. We know that they are faced with
  temptations similar to those we experience when trying to follow Our Blessed
  Lord and His Holy Church with more generosity. We know that they rely on our
  own prayer and friendship in order to let God’s grace work through them and
  bear more abundant fruit. In other words, we experience the “communion of
  saints” manifest in a framework we have freely chosen.
</p>
<p>
  As baptized young adults, as members of the Mystical Body of Our Lord Jesus
  Christ, we already partake in the communion of saints. Like various
  sodalities, third-orders, and pious societies in Church history, Juventutem
  only particularizes the universal circulation of graces for a specific group
  of souls according to specific means, as inspired by the needs felt in new
  circumstances.
</p>
<p><strong>Our circumstances</strong></p>
<p>
  We live in difficult times. Whereas the number of well trained pastors is
  lowering, worldly means to allure our souls are multiplying. Particularly in
  so-called “developed countries”, being a Catholic is objectively more
  difficult nowadays than it used to be some decades ago. We especially, as
  youths, are targeted by false guides presenting pleasure and independence as
  an end in itself instead of the only freedom and joy found in answering God’s
  call to holiness!
</p>
<p>
  Many of our fellow baptized Catholic youths have deserted the churches, have
  no time for Catholic devotions, and neither seek nor learn sound Catholic
  doctrine. The liturgy, the doctrine, and the apostolate most of them have been
  presented with failed to attract their interest. Most modern youths find that
  too often, those acting in the name of the Catholic Church are not convincing.
  We can’t see why we would sacrifice various earthly satisfactions to answer an
  invitation where transcendence does not show.
</p>
<p>
  Thank be to God, there are signs of a renewal. We know for certain that the
  Lord does not abandon His Church. We give Him thanks for the grace of having
  been put, without any merit on our part, on board that Ark of salvation
  governed by our Holy Father Pope Francis.
</p>
<p><strong>Our means</strong></p>
<p>
  Our common aspiration as Juventutem members is to draw our sanctification from
  the traditional liturgy and spirituality of Holy Mother Church. Having
  discovered what a valuable support the Roman Rite (according to the Missal of
  Pope St. John XXIII) is to our souls, as well as the doctrinal presentations
  of the divine truths so eloquently expressed by that very special form of the
  Roman rite, we desire to use them always more fruitfully. To which end we
  require the support of prayer, friendship and learning. Those values we expect
  to use and share through Juventutem, as much as it pleases Our Blessed Lord
  and His Mother Immaculate. The more we will assimilate the Roman traditions of
  the Church so as to be sanctified in them, the more God will touch other
  people through us. Thus we will find our fulfillment in humbly and joyfully
  helping to forward God’s grace across His creation.
</p>
<p>Practically:</p>
<p>
  Added on the first three commitments – that anchor each member’s day and week
  – a meeting of the members should take place on a regular basis. The backbone
  of the Juventutem activities would seem to be this monthly meeting including
  an informal meal, a doctrinal talk given by a (sound) cleric, preceded by Holy
  Mass (whenever the “forma extraordinaria” is made available) and/or followed
  with Holy Hour. This meeting does naturally not forbid friendly recreation,
  such as watching together an appropriate film for instance.
</p>
<p><strong>So small!</strong></p>
<p>
  Saint Theresa of Avila says that we should have high expectations for
  holiness. Nothing to do with pride, as we try and do our poor little best,
  cooperating with God’s almighty grace. Just like us, Juventutem is but a tiny
  and imperfect tool. We are but a handful of youths spread thin all over the
  world. Lack of time and of money makes it rather difficult for us to travel
  across the oceans and meet with each other – though we aspire to do so, when
  able.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks be to God, we don’t need to invent anything, since Holy Mother Church
  has everything ready for us. Valuable Roman traditions served by dedicated
  pastors are becoming more and more appreciated nowadays. Several of us who are
  still unable to attend the special Roman rite (Roman Missal revised by Pope
  St.&nbsp;John XXIII in 1962) on a regular basis can nevertheless read a lot
  about it on the Internet, see pictures and videos, and occasionally, on
  pilgrimages or other faith gatherings, attend Holy Masses offered in that most
  venerable liturgy.
</p>
<p>
  Whatever the distances, our mutual prayer and our shared interest for the holy
  traditions of the Church know no border. If you are young and attracted by the
  Roman traditions of the Catholic Church, you are welcome to join us, already
  through prayer. We pray for you.

<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>
  The name « Juventutem » was mentioned for the first time on the 24th of May
  2004, in correspondence between the founders of Juventutem. May 24th is the
  Feast of Our Lady Help of Christians. Following the victory of Christendom
  over the Turks at Lepanto, in the Ionian islands (1571), the Pope, St. Pius V,
  had inserted in the litanies to the Blessed Virgin the invocation to Our
  Lady&nbsp;<em>Help of Christians</em>.&nbsp;It was also under this title that
  Pope Pius VII created a feast day, on the 24th of May, in honor of the Virgin
  Mary, to express his gratitude for deliverance in 1814 from exile and the
  captivity imposed on him by Napoleon I. 24th May is considered to be the
  anniversary of Juventutem. The&nbsp;<em
    >Fœderatio Internationalis Juventutem</em
  >, was founded at Berne in Switzerland on 24 May 2006.
</p>
<p>
  Juventutem made itself manifest for the first time in August 2005 (in Bavaria
  and then in Düsseldorf and Cologne) during the triennial World Youth Days.
  From its inception, however, Juventutem was intended to be a permanent
  structure with the purpose of sanctifying young traditional Catholics by
  demonstrating their diversity and vitality in regular activities.
</p>
<p>
  Juventutem was founded in the context of the Year of the Eucharist, decreed
  and&nbsp;<a
    href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/it/homilies/2004/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20041017_year-eucharist.html"
    target="_blank"
    style="color: rgb(25, 130, 209)"
    >inaugurated</a
  >&nbsp;by Pope John Paul II in October 2004 and&nbsp;<a
    href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/it/homilies/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20051023_canonizations.html"
    target="_blank"
    style="color: rgb(25, 130, 209)"
    >concluded</a
  >&nbsp;by Pope Benedict XVI in October 2005. Since its beginning and in
  future, Juventutem has entrusted and will entrust its members and works to the
  Son of God made Man, Jesus Christ our Savior, present in the Blessed
  Eucharist. Juventutem will be represented by a monstrance with, in its center,
  the Blessed Host. The word Juventutem will also be shown in blue below the
  monstrance, thus demonstrating the Marian character of Juventutem. The year
  2005, proclaimed as Year of the Eucharist, also marked the 150th anniversary
  of the proclamation of the dogma of Immaculate Conception and our association
  was consecrated to Our Lady on Good Friday, the 25th of March 2005, coinciding
  with the Feast of the Annunciation.
